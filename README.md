# Applied Statistics Project: customer-purchase-behavior_Analysis


## Overview
This repository represents the culmination of my efforts in the mid-course summative assignment/project for the Full Stack Data Science and AI course at Almabetter. 
The project focuses on Applied Statistics, offering insights into customer behavior through comprehensive statistical analysis.

## Project Structure
The project is structured around five main tasks, each addressing different facets of statistical analysis:

## Task 1 - Basic CleanUp:
* Preprocessed and wrangled the dataset.
* Handled outliers and ensured data consistency.

## Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics ðŸ“Š:
* Explored central tendencies and variations.
* Identified potential outliers.

## Task 3 - Probability Distributions ðŸŽ²:
* Identified distributions for relevant variables.
* Calculated probabilities and expected values based on these distributions.

## Task 4: Insights and Customer Segmentation ðŸ“ˆ:
* Explored relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits.
* Utilized KMeans clustering for customer segmentation.

## Task 5: Conclusion and Recommendations:
* Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Libraries Used
* pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy: Numerical operations and array manipulation.
* scipy: Scientific computing and statistical analysis.
* matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
* sklearn: Machine learning, specifically KMeans clustering.
